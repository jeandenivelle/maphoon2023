about these parser generator tools. 

I created maphoon in 2007 and because of this I would like to use 
it in our project, and publish it. If in the end maybe 150 people will use
it like we used CUP in compiler construction, it will be worth 
that we spend some time to it. 

These are the options: 
1. Make maphoon the best parser generator in the world, 
   use it, and publish it.
2. or admit that another parser generator is the best parser generator in
   the world, use it for our project, and completely forget about maphoon.

We must have a serious look at possible other parser generators, and then
decide. 
I think the real competitors are BisonC++ and BisonC. So please
have a serious look at these. If you find others, please also look at those. 

We certainly need a parser generator tool for our project, so either we use
maphoon and make it publishable, or we don't use it, abandon it, 
and use something else.

Selection criteria are:
- bottom up (LALR)
- good treatment of polymorphic attributes. User of parser should not
  have to worry about memory management. 
- Nice user interface. 
- Convenient Installation.
